description:  As part of my <a href="https://www.wsqcap.com/index.html">Contracted Work</a>, I was tasked with updating and remaking a website using Bootstrap. To enhance its functionality, I incorporated vanilla JS and utilized a JS widget known as theFinancials.com. This widget enabled the site to pull real-time data, such as stock prices and market trends, and display them in an interactive and visually appealing way.
